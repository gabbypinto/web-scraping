  Our project idea is to allow the user to save a list (or lists) of e-commerce
products from any website. Although the user could hypothetically save this
in their bookmarkâ€™s tab or save them in their notes; the user would be able to
access this list anywhere and anytime. In the web application, the user pastes
a URL link and the program will scrap through the given URL for the product
name, price of the product, and a picture of the product. Some additional
features include organizing the list by location (which will be used by the
google maps API), sharing the website links with other users, and organizing
the list by its price
